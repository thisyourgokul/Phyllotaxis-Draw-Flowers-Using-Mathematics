Project Description:

R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.
The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.

Project Tasks:

1. Patterns in nature
2. Warming up: drawing points on a circle
3. Make it harmonious with the Golden Angle
4. Remove everything unnecessary
5. A bit of makeup: size, color and transparency
6. Play with aesthetics: the dandelion
7. Put all it together: the sunflower
8. What if you modify the angle?
9. All together now: imaginary flowers
